# Assignment 11 : AI Assistant

# 1. Overview üìñ
In this assignment, we are supposed to build 3-pages AI Assistant app as follows :
1. **First Page** : Welcome Page, where a simple message and continue button are shown.
2. **Second Page** : Choices Page, where user can choose a topic to start conversation with AI Assistant.
3. **Third Page** : Chat page, where a conversation is taking place between user and AI Assistant.

# 2. Widgets used üé®
Two Types of widgets were used :
- **Basic Widgets**
- **Custom Widgets**

## 2.1 Basic Widgets
In this section, I will breifly mention some of the basic widgets I have used in the app.
### 2.1.1 AppBar
This widget represents the top horizontal bar in the scaffold, it contains three main elements. See Image (1) :
- a) **Leading** : a widget that appears before the title.
- b) **Title** : a widget that is displayed in the center of the app bar.
- c) **Actions** : a list of widgets that appears after the title.

### 2.1.2 SizedBox
This widget represents a box with a fixed size. See Image (2).
It accepts three attributes :
- a) **width** : width of the box.
- b) **height** : height of the box.
- c) **child** : a widget that is in the box.
Sometimes, we use SizedBox as an empty space between elements in the interface

### 2.1.3 TextButton
This widget represents a button with text in it that can be passed through child attribute. See Image (2).
