## Flutter Navigation

In Flutter, navigating between screens is straightforward with the `Navigator` widget. This tool lets you push new routes onto the stack, which displays different screens, and pop routes to return to previous ones. Itâ€™s also handy for passing data between screens and handling dynamic routes.

For more in-depth information on navigation patterns, you can check out the official Flutter documentation.
