# Chat bot UI

The code consists of three main classes: `HomePage`, `Opitons`, and `Chat`, each utilizing various Flutter widgets to build the UI.

## Widgets Used:

### 1. `Scaffold`
- Provides the primary structure for the visual layout of each screen, containing the app bar, body, and other components.

### 2. `SafeArea`
- Ensures that the UI avoids system intrusions, such as notches or status bars, by adding padding around the content.

### 3. `Stack`
- Allows layering of child widgets on top of each other, enabling flexible positioning.

### 4. `Center`
- Centers its child widget within its parent, providing alignment to the middle of the screen.

### 5. `Padding`
- Adds padding around its child widget, creating space and separation between elements.

### 6. `Column`
  - Arranges its child widgets in a vertical layout, stacking them one on top of the other.

### 7. `Text`
- Displays text content with customizable styling, such as font size, color, and alignment.

### 8. `Positioned`
- Positions its child widget within a `Stack` at specified coordinates.

### 9. `ElevatedButton`
- A material design button that provides an elevated look and feel, often used for triggering actions or navigation.

### 10. `AppBar`
- A material design app bar that sits at the top of the screen, containing a title, navigation buttons, and actions.

### 11. `IconButton`
- A button that displays an icon, typically used for navigation or triggering actions within the `AppBar`.

### 12. `Row`
- Arranges its child widgets horizontally, placing them side by side.

### 13. `SingleChildScrollView`
- Provides a scrollable view that ensures all child widgets are visible, even if they extend beyond the screen.

### 14. `GestureDetector`
- Detects gestures like taps, allowing interaction with non-button widgets.

### 15. `Container`
- A versatile widget that can contain other widgets, and be styled with borders, colors, and padding.

### 16. `Icon`
- Displays an icon from the Material Design library, often used for visual elements like buttons or indicators.
